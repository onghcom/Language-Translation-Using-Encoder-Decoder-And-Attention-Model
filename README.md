# Language-Translation-Using-Encoder-Decoder-And-Attention-Model
This project required translation of Italian language to English. Implemented two models to achieve this task one with Encoder-Decoder models and other with Encoder-Decoder using Attention Mechanism. In Attention, we used 3 types of scoring function- dot, general and concat.

Implementation of custom Encoder-Decoder includes data loading and preprocessing, implementation of custom encoder and decoder, creation of data pipeline, model training, output inference and BLEU metric evaluation.

The custom Encoder-Decoder with Attention includes data loading and preprocessing, implementation of custom encoder, decoder and attention layer, custom loss function. For all the three scoring function includes creation of data pipeline, model training, output prediction and BLEU metric evaluation.
